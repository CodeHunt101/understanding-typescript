Installation

- run tsc to compile
- remmeber to include the compiled js instead of the ts file

Using types

- JavaScript uses dynamic types (resolved at runtime) whereas TypeScript uses "static types" (set during development)

Array types

- any[] helps you declare an array of any value. Not to use often.
